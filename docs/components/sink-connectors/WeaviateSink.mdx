title: 'WeaviateSink'
description: 'WeaviateSink facilitates the storage and retrieval of vectorized data in the Weaviate vector database, allowing for efficient semantic search capabilities.'
---

The `WeaviateSink` class is designed to integrate with the Weaviate vector database, storing vectors produced from the Neum AI pipeline and retrieving them for semantic search operations.

## Properties

Required properties:
- `url`: The URL of the Weaviate instance.
- `api_key`: The API key for authentication with the Weaviate service.
- `class_name`: The name of the class in Weaviate to store the data. Can be defined to any string you want.

Optional properties:
- `num_workers`: The number of workers used for batch processing.
- `shard_count`: The number of shards for the Weaviate class.
- `batch_size`: The number of vectors to store in a single batch.
- `is_dynamic_batch`: A flag indicating if batching should adapt based on the response time of the Weaviate instance.
- `batch_connection_error_retries`: The number of retries for batch connection errors.
