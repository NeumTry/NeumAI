```python Local Development
from neumai.SinkConnectors import SupabaseSink

# Initialize the SupabaseSink connector with the database connection string
supabase_sink = SupabaseSink(
    database_connection = "postgresql://postgres:<password>@<host>:<port>/postgres",
    collection_name = "collection-name"
)
```
