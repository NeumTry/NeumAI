title: 'Sharepoint Connector'
description: 'Retrieve data from a Sharepoint site'
---

Connect to an existing Microsoft Sharepoint site and extract all the documents associated to the site.

## Prerequisites

To access Sharepoint, you will need to create an application registration within your tenant's Azure Active Directory (or Azure Entrata ID). Throughout the setup process you will need to collect:

- `Tenant ID`: ID of your Sharepoint tenant
- `Client ID`: ID for the app registration you created
- `Client Secret`: Secret for the application registration you created

Set up process:

- To create registration follow instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/how-to-register-ciam-app?tabs=graphapi)
- Once created, you will need to add the following API permissions. See instruction [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/how-to-register-ciam-app?tabs=graphapi#grant-api-access-to-your-application) You will need to enable the following permissions:
  - Microsoft Graph > Sites.FullControl.All
- Once added, you will need to grant admin consent for the application.

- Next you will need to create a secret for the application. See instruction [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/how-to-register-ciam-app?tabs=graphapi#create-a-client-secret-1)

- To get the `site_id` for your Sharepoint site, in a browser go to: `https://<Sharepoint domain>/sites/<Sharepoint Site Name>/_api/site/id`. Copy the GUID provided in the XML response.
