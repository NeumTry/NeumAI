title: 'RecursiveChunker'
description: 'The RecursiveChunker class is tailored for segmenting text into smaller chunks with a recursive approach, allowing for different levels of text granularity.'
---

The `RecursiveChunker` class specializes in dividing text into smaller, more manageable sections using a recursive method. This allows for various levels of granularity depending on the specified separators.

## Properties

Required properties:
- None

Optional properties:
- `chunk_size`: The target size for each text chunk.
- `chunk_overlap`: The amount of overlap desired between adjacent text chunks.
- `batch_size`: The number of text chunks to process together.
- `separators`: A list of strings used to split the text at different granularity levels.

    chunk_overlap = 50,
    batch_size = 1000,
    separators = ["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]
