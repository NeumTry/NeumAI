## Overview

Through the Neum AI platform, you can create and manage your data pipelines. The platform abstracts away the complexity of keeping state and context across your pipelines and makes it easy to perform actions against them.

## Pipeline actions

| Actions | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Create](/platform-apis/endpoint/create-a-pipeline)  | Pipeline record is created and tracked. First-run is executed. |
| [Trigger](/platform-apis/endpoint/trigger-a-pipeline)  | Run an existing pipeline. Can choose from full or delta sync modes. |
| [Query](/platform-apis/endpoint/query-a-pipeline)  | Query the data extracted in a given pipeline. |
| [Query feedback](/platform-apis/endpoint/post-feedback-retrieval)  | Record feedback for a pipeline query result. |
| [Cancel](/platform-apis/endpoint/cancel-a-pipeline-run)  | Cancel a pipeline run. |

## Pipeline information

In addition to actions, there are APIs available to get information about a given [pipeline](/platform-apis/endpoint/get-pipeline) and [pipeline run](/platform-apis/endpoint/get-pipeline-run).
