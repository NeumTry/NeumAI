In addition to the Neum AI Framework, we offer a managed cloud platform that allows you to host and manage your RAG data pipelines. The platform provides the same level of flexibility and modularity provided by the framework, but also the scale and reliability of having the framework run in a bespoke enviornment.

## Platform features
