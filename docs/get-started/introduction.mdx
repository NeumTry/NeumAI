## What is Neum AI?

Neum AI is a best-in-class framework to build your data infrastructure for Retrieval Augmented Generation and Semantic Search. It provides a collection of connectors to help you quickly spin up data pipelines that take your existing unstructured and structured data and converts it into vector embeddings ready to be used to generate search indexes. Neum AI then helps you scale up your pipeline to process millions of vectors through its managed platform as well as keeping all the vectors up to date, even as your underlying data is changing.


## Case study
Take a look at our case study for how we moved billions of vectors in this [blog post](https://medium.com/@neum_ai/retrieval-augmented-generation-at-scale-building-a-distributed-system-for-synchronizing-and-eaa29162521)!
