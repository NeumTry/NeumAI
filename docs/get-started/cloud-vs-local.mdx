## Picking the right enviornment

Neum AI offers both local and cloud capabilities. Local development is a great starting place to test out the different Neum AI connectors and piece together your first flows. You can get a sense of the pre-processing options offered and run small to medium size workloads right on your machine. The cloud enviorment come into play as you look to scale your solution to a larger dataset, as well as look for production-ready features like scheduling, real-time synchronization, logs and support.
