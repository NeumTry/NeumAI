**Neum AI is a data platform that helps developers connect their data to vector databases.** This includes extracting data from existing data sources like document storage and NoSQL, processing the contents into vector embeddings and ingesting the vector embeddings into vector databases. You can find more information about [Neum AI Cloud](https://neum.ai).

In this repository, we have included tools that the Neum AI team has built to help in process of ingesting and processing data.

- [neumai-tools](https://pypi.org/project/neumai-tools/): contains pre-processing tools for loading and chunking data before generating vector embeddings.
